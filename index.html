      What is a paragraph? Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many
      students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of
      at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality,
      though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what
      constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences
      or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length
      and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a
      paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly Rupa
      Shah..... journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
      Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support
      one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling
      idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

      Step 1. Decide on a controlling idea and create a topic sentence Paragraph
      development begins with the formulation of the controlling idea. This idea
      directs the paragraph’s development. Often, the controlling idea of a
      paragraph will appear in the form of a topic sentence. In some cases, you
      may need more than one sentence to express a paragraph’s controlling idea.
